    -	The application must get a score of 80 or more in the Performance metric of Google Lighthouse.
-	Scalability:
    -	The application must handle increases in load with no effect on performance and with minimal additional cost.
-	Security:
    - The application must enforce the restrictions on each of the three roles.
    -	Editing and deleting posts and replies by users must be restricted to the original author.
    -	The application must ensure high availability of its services with the use of clustering.

## Technologies and Software
We will implement our application using Django, a powerful python web framework. Django includes a built in ORM library, and an authentication library that will allow us to fulfill the authenticity requirement. While Django includes a built-in web server, it is only meant for development. We will use Apache httpd as our web server, with which Django communicates using WSGI.
To satisfy the high availability requirement, we will place a cluster of load balancers in front of our application servers. These will be running Nginx, and coordinating with each other using Linux HA.
